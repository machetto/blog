```
When you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers,
you know something about it, when you cannot express it in numbers,
your knowledge is of a meager and unsatisfactory kind;
it may be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarely,
in your thoughts advanced to the stage of science.
